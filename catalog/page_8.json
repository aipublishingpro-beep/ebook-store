    "description": "The first missiles screamed across the pre-dawn darkness of the Middle East at 4:47 AM local time on June 13, 2025.

Behind her, more than two hundred Israeli warplanes formed the largest aerial as...",

Paris was supposed to be the place I painstakingly pieced it all back together, or maybe drew a new one, free of detours and dead ends. Instead, I stumbled. Straight into a room I shouldn't have entered, and into the orbit of a man who was less a destination an...",
