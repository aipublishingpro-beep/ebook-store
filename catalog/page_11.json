Three months ago, this scene would have been impossible. Not because I didn't want to be present with her, but because I literally couldn't. My brain had been hijacked by a device designed to capture and commodify my attenti...",

Rain slicks the streets, reflecting the neon glow of a world that never truly sleeps, a world that watches with a million unseen eyes. For some, this is the backdrop of ordinary life \u2013 commutes, coffee, fleeting moments of joy or despair. For others, like Kestrel, it\u2019s a hunting ground, a maze of shadows where survival is a curr...",

It was yet another paper on AI, not just using AI, but AI doing science...",

She'd learned early that princes were usually wolves in disguise, and happy endings were just stories people told themselves to sleep better at night. But sometimes, when the rain falls hard enough and the darkness closes in, even the most cynical heart can find itself hoping for salvation.",

Others are shouted from the rooftops, blindingly bright and seen by all. This is the story of a love that dared to exist in both, a melody composed in a secret studio and a photograph developed in a darkened room. It\u2019s the story of a girl who collected pieces of the city\u2019s soul and...",
